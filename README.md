## 👋 Hey, I'm Caio

###Reading data to understand real-world scenarios — with storytelling, structure, and a builder’s mindset.
Creative, analytical, and hands-on by nature. I learn by doing, experiment with intent, and keep things practical.
Still early in the journey, facing hard tasks head-on until they work.
— Just someone who solves problems with clarity and builds with purpose.
